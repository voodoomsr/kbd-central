These two type of selectors lets you apply styles and even content base in two new semantics:

* Pseudo Classes: define the style of a special ''state'' of an element. For example :hover (mouse over the element)
* Pseudo Element: define the style of a special ''part'' of an element. For example ::after (following element) lets you add content after the element. Another exapmple ::first-letter, as the name implies lets you apply a style over the first letter of an element.
